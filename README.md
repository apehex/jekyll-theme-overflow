# Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/[USERNAME]/hello. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant][contributor-covenant] code of conduct.

# Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `jekyll-theme-overflow.gemspec` accordingly.

This is Overflow, a single page responsive site template by me, AJ, for HTML5 UP.
As you can tell it's a bit unusual (it was inspired by a flowchart I was working
on a few months back), but I think it'd make for a pretty cool portfolio. Includes
a pop-up gallery, styling for all basic page elements, a handy configuration
(see the top of js/init.js), and some experimental stuff I've been messing with
lately (like the parallax background effect).

Demo images* courtesy of the talented, the awesome, THE one and only Felicia Simion,
a photographer whose works will make your head spin in awe. See more of it here:
